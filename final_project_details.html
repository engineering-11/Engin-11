     <h1> Final Projects </h1>
     <div id="mcontent">
        <p>
          You will have the last 2 to 3 weeks to complete your final project.
          Following that period, each group will give a 15 minute presentation
          of their final project results to the class. A final report will be
          due by the end of term.
        </p>

        <p>
          This final project presentation and report is in place of a final
          exam. You will be expected to include elements of the content covered
          in the lectures, and your lab experiences, including technical details
          describing how your detection system acquires data and the associated
          experimental uncertainties, and the correct application of statistical
          methods in the analysis of your data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Potential projects include, but are not limited to, those described
          in the list bellow. You are encouraged to propose your own topics if
          there is something you want to explore that is not listed below. We
          will spend lab time working with each group to provide the input and
          resources, including some of the software, necessary to successfully
          get started with any of the ideas listed, or work with your group to
          ensure you will be able to collect and analyze the necessary data for
          your proposed project.

      <h2> Final Project Suggestions </h2>

      <button class="collapsible">Radiation Mapping</button>
      <div class="ccontent">
        <ul>
          <li> Mapping and identifying sources of background radiation
               around campus. Which areas of campus have higher/lower
               background levels and which sources are contributing to
               those levels? </li>
          <li> Map out radiation levels in Etcheverry Hall, or other
               buildings on campus, and determine potential causes for any
               observed significant variation. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      &nbsp;

      <button class="collapsible">Identifying Sources</button>
      <div class="ccontent">
        Identifying the isotopes present and determining the activity of
        unknown sources of radiation. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            We will supply the sources and ask
            you to determine what radioactive materials it contains and at what
            rate they are producing radiation - the activity.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      &nbsp;

      <button class="collapsible">Contextualizing Radiation</button>
      <div class="ccontent">
        Exploring environmental factors leading to variations in local
        background radiation rates. This project can go in two directions,
        each of which could be done by different teams. The options are:
        <ul>
          <li> Explore large-scale environmental factors using data
            from our radiation sensor network. Are there weather effects
            or other factors (temperature, etc.) that correlate with radiation
            levels? </li>
          <li> Explore more localized effects using your portable devices
            - with our portable spectrometers - combining radiation and
            environmental sensor data. Are there correlations between
            air quality, etc. and radiation levels locally? What could
            be the explanation for this?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
          &nbsp;

      <button class="collapsible">Radiation Sensor Calibration</button>
      <div class="ccontent">
        A radiation detector requires calibration if it is to be used to provide
        a measure of the absolute radiation levels or dose, rather than basic
        counts and relative changes in radiation levels. Working within the limitations 
        of the materials you will have access to, come up with a calibration procedure to 
        determine how the counts registered in your radiation sensor relate to true radiation 
        rates from sources. 
        <ul>
          <li> Fully establish your systematic uncertainties related to this calibration
            procedure and test your procedure with known sources. </li>
          <li> NOTE: We will provide guidance and any necessary materials, such as additional
            radiation detectors that are already calibrated, calibration sources, etc. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <button class="collapsible">Understanding Dose-rate</button>
      <div class="ccontent">
        Explore the energy dependence of dose-rate.
        <ul>
          <li>
            We calibrate our dosimeters using sources that roughly mimic the 
            spectral composition we find naturally - is this sufficient? What 
            systematics does this introduce to our dose-rate estimate? Could we 
            improve this with a different calibration procedure?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      &nbsp;

      <button class="collapsible">Environmental Sensor Calibration</button>
      <div class="ccontent">
        The various environmental sensors that have been integrated into your 
        multi-sensor device may not be acquirate. Come up with a procedure for 
        verifying the accuracy of one of the environmental sensors. There are 
        several ways you may approach this - either through lab tests or 
        comparisons of deployed devices with other sensor networks.
        <ul>
          <li> Fully establish your systematic uncertainties related to this calibration
            procedure and test your procedure with known sources. </li>
          <li> NOTE: We will provide guidance and pointers to any necessary materials. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      &nbsp;

      <button class="collapsible"> Adding new Sensors</button>
      <div class="ccontent">
        Integrate new sensors, such as altimeters, magnetometers, etc. This
        would be an extension of the work done to integrate the base set of
        sensors our systems use.
          <li>
            These are new sensors: this project would require new software
            or readout modifications to the electronics boards for interfacing
            with the Raspberry Pi for final integration into the full system.
          </li>
          <li>
            As part of this project, you will be expected to come up with an 
            experiment or set of experiments to varify the performance of the 
            new sensor and establish the sensitivity, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      &nbsp;

      <button class="collapsible">Graphical User Interface (GUI)</button>
      <div class="ccontent">
        The software developed throughout this semester relies on a command-line
        interface. Data collection in the field or for non-experts is greatly 
        facilitated by a graphical interface. Similarly, immediate diplay of the
        data being recorded can be quite useful.
        <ul>
          <li>Create a GUI for starting data collection and showing current readings 
            for the sensors on your device.</li>
          <li> NOTE: this is a programming intensive project and should only be 
            selected by a group with an existing and strong background in software 
            development. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      &nbsp;

      <button class="collapsible">PCB design</button>
      <div class="ccontent">
        We have a PCB design for the circuit board we use for the interface between our sensors and
        the Raspberry Pi. This leaves us with a fixed set of inputs available in a fixed configuration, 
        which may limit options for new sensor inputs, etc. To add new inputs, you would be required to 
        create a new PCB design that included these new inputs, and possibly modified the existing 
        configuration to accomodate these updates.
        <ul>
          <li>Using <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview">Eagle</a>,
            which you can download for free through campus by creating an
            Autodesk account using your Berkeley credentials, create a new PCB design.
          <li>Come up with a potential new input/output (LED controls, etc.) and modify/improve/personalize 
            the design to incorporate this new feature. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      &nbsp;

      <button class="collapsible">3D Case Design</button>
      <div class="ccontent">
        The existing case for our portable devices were 3D printed from a model developed by several
        students. There are a range of potential improvements one could imagine developing.
        <ul>
          <li>Design an enclosure for your Raspberry Pi system, including
            screen, circuit board, and any sensors or other components you want
            housed inside the enclosure. </li>
          <li>Use <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview#">Autodesk Inventor</a>
            is recommended, although this software only runs on the Windows 64-
            bit OS. There are alternatives, including open source options like
            Blender, but Inventor is the most intuitive. We will have a laptop
            with Inventor installed available if needed.</li>
          <li>YPrints can be done through Jacobs Hall, there is a training
            you will need to complete to get access to those printers.</li>
        </ul>
