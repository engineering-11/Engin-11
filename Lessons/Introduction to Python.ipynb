The line `b = a` created the variable `b` as a reference to the *same memory location* as `a`. So, when we change the values being stored at that memory location using `a` as the reference, `b` also changes. This is a fundamental property of **mutable** data types. Lists are **mutable**, meaning that the data the list, or any mutable type, stores can be changed. \n",

If you say `a = 2`, so `a` is a reference to the value `2`, you cannot change `2`, `2` is always `2`. All you can do is change `a` to reference a different value. This is also true for strings and tuples: they **immutable**. This is why even though we can access individual elements of strings and tuples, we cannot change those elements.
