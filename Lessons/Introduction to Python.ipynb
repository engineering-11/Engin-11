    "\n",
    "### int\n",
    "An `int` is a signed (positive or negative) whole number. Standard ints are 4 bytes, so can range from -2147483648 to 2147483647. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Where does this range come from?**\n",
    "Let's consider the example of a small int: a small int is 1 byte, meaning it can range from -128 to 127. One byte is 8 bits (a bit holding a binary value 0 or 1), so there are 7 bits for the integer value - allowing the max value 2^7 - and one bit for the sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "### float\n",
    "A `float` is a floating point (real) number, which can have fractional or decimal values. Mathematically, there are an infinite number of real numbers. In computing, the `float` type has to have a finite size, usually 4 bytes, so by definition there will be a finite set of numbers that can be expressed this way. Generally the range and precision of floats is set using this exact representation form:\n",
    "\n",
    "`significand x base^exponent`\n",
    "\n",
    "where the significand is an integer, the length of which sets the precision of the number, and the exponent is also an integer. In computing the base is 2 (binary). The standard 32-bit - single precision - format is 24 bits of precision, 7 bits for the exponent, and one for the sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "### string\n",
    "A character string, usually called a `string` or `str` is simply text. The more fundamental data type is the `char` - a 1-byte type representing a single letter, number, or symbol. In python, there is no single character type, a single character is simply a string of length one. A string is a character array, meaning unlike ints and floats it is not a single value. Therefore, although strings are often manipulated as if they were single values, there a few fundamental differences that we will encounter resulting from the non-singular nature of the `string` type.

    "  * `int64`: that simply means that these are 64-bit (8-byte) integers, rather than the 4-byte default\n",
    "  * `float64`: again, 64-bit floats (double precision) rather than 32-bit. \n",
    "  * new string types: here the `U` indicates `unicode`, which is the particular way of encoding symbols and characters, `U1` is a 1-byte `char` - the usual - and `U32` is a 32-bit (4-byte) `char`. This larger size is chosen when floats are represented by strings because floats can generally be much larger in size than single characters.\n",

This is also true for strings and tuples: they **immutable**. This is why even though we can access individual elements of strings and tuples, we cannot change those elements.

    "\n",
    "### Built-in Functions\n",
    "We've already seen several examples of functions: `print`, `len`, `type`, and even the `int`, `float`, and `string` functions that changed an existing value from one type to another. These are all built-in functions (meaning they are part of the basic Python interpreter and do not require the `import` of a particular library) that apply broadly, although `len` only applies to list-like types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few general rules about functions:\n",
    "* an *argument* is a value passed into a function\n",
    "* Functions can take zero arguments\n",
    "* To call a function, you must use round brackets, even if you give no arguments, so that Python knows a function is being called: `(<argument>)`\n",
    "* Functions can take multiple arguments, separated by commas: `function(arg1, arg2, ...)`\n",
    "* Functions always return a value. If no return value is provided within the function code block, it will return None\n",
